**Introduction**: The importance of bond investment as a component of financial portfolios is undisputed. However, investing in bonds carries certain risks, including default, interest rate, and credit risks. Hence, it is crucial to accurately assess these risks to make informed investment decisions. Machine learning techniques have been gaining increasing attention in recent years, and this study aims to predict bond investment risks using Standard & Poor's (S&P) rating and regression models. The study evaluates the effectiveness of regression models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forest, in predicting bond investment risks using the S&P rating as a predictor variable.

**Background**: Traditional methods of predicting bond investment risks rely on credit ratings provided by credit rating agencies, such as S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. These methods have limitations and require additional factors for accurate predictions. Machine learning has gained popularity in finance due to its ability to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions with high accuracy. Therefore, using machine learning to predict bond investment risks could provide valuable insights for investors and financial institutions, helping them to make informed investment decisions and manage risks.

**Significance of the Study**: The research holds significant importance for the financial sector, as it evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting bond investment risks using the S&P rating as a predictor variable. The study highlights the potential of this approach in providing valuable insights to investors and financial institutions to make informed investment decisions and manage risks effectively. The analysis could help researchers and practitioners to develop better machine-learning models for risk prediction in the future.

**Objectives of the Study**: The study has three primary objectives. First, to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting bond investment risks using the S&P rating as a predictor variable. Second, to identify the most effective regression model for predicting bond investment risks. Third, to highlight the potential of machine learning in providing valuable insights for investors and financial institutions to make informed investment decisions and manage risks effectively.

**Methodology**: The study used a dataset of bonds rated by S&P, including various features such as bond type, industry, and maturity. The study evaluated three regression models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forest, to predict bond investment risks using the S&P rating as a predictor variable. The study used accuracy as the primary evaluation metric to compare the performance of different models.

**Results**: The study found that the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 80% in predicting bond investment
